TarsosDSP is a Java library for audio processing. Its aim is to provide an easy-to-use interface to practical music processing algorithms implemented, as simply as possible, in pure Java and without any other external dependencies. The library tries to hit the sweet spot between being capable enough to get real tasks done but compact and simple enough to serve as a demonstration on how DSP algorithms works.

TarsosDSP features an implementation of a percussion onset detector and a number of *pitch detection algorithms*: YIN, the Mcleod Pitch method and a “Dynamic Wavelet Algorithm Pitch Tracking” algorithm. Also included is a *Goertzel DTMF*(Dual tone multi frequency) decoding algorithm, a time stretch algorithm (WSOLA), resampling, *filters*, simple synthesis, some *audio effects*, and a pitch shifting algorithm.

To show the capabilities of the library, "TarsosDSP example applications":http://0110.be/tag/TarsosDSP are available. Head over to the "TarsosDSP release directory":http://0110.be/releases/TarsosDSP/ for freshly baked binaries and code smell free (that is the goal anyway), oven-fresh sources.
